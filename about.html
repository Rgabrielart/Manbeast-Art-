<div class="header">Iv enjoyed art at a very young age. Iv started with coloring books and tracing paper that my father brought home from work. Growing up Iv picked up tips and tricks from friends, teachers and a great assortment of people from online tutorials to comic cons. The key is Repetition and never stop learning. That’s what helps me. I work hard every day and still find some time during my busy schedule to draw or doodle. When I watch a movie or have chores to do in my daily life, I still find art in everything I do. The extra push I have to say I received was from my wife. Many people in our world have a real talent for art but few hardly see a career in it. Most don’t see the rewards of such a journey. I’m sure I will come across some bumps and hardships. But it’ll be a ride I won’t want to forget. Some people ask what is the limit of what I can draw? Nudity? Violence? People? Robots? Well I respond with “Nothing. There is no limit! I will work hard to create or design any idea you have.” I don’t want to have a limit. I don’t ever want to say there I can’t draw that. I practice when I can. And when I can’t I’m thinking of what I can do next. 
My father used to draw but gave up on it when he had to work hard to provide for his family. Long grueling hours at work hardly give the time to draw as much as we need. My inspiration comes from films, comics, and other sorts of fantasy. I’m a fan of horror movies. Not for the violence but the crazy stories that are created. Though I do like music. Music isn’t a turning point in my life. A good fantasy story is what opens my mind to such creative ideas. There is no ending to me learning art. I will continue to learn and help others in what I know to better help the art community. Don’t ever be a stranger to ask anything art related to me. If you have a question Ill do my best to answer it.
