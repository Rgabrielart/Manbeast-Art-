<div class="header">Welcome to my page! Youâ€™re in the right place for Manbeast Art. Art is a beautiful thing. This sort of talent can invoke all kinds of feelings. Calmness, Anxiety, inspiration, not just for the artist but for the spectator as well. This talent goes across the board for music, performing arts, Painting.   But when does it stop becoming a hobby and more like a career? My type of Art is more than an average doodle. It's my dream, goal, and life.
	Mr.Frank Miller , Art dealer , Believes i have real potential in making it in the Art community. ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡
